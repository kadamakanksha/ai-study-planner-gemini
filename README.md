AI Study Planner
A full-stack web application for creating personalized study plans and tracking learning progress.




⚠️ Note: The application may take up to 30–60 seconds to load on first visit due to free hosting (cold start on Render).

📌 Overview
AI Study Planner is a complete full-stack application that helps students create customized study schedules, track their progress, and achieve their learning goals. With support for multiple subjects and difficulty levels, users can generate personalized study plans in seconds. The application is named AI Study Planner because it uses intelligent decision-making logic to automatically generate personalized study schedules. Instead of static or pre-defined plans, the system dynamically adapts learning paths based on user inputs, progress, and time availability — simulating human-like planning behavior.

✨ Key Features
